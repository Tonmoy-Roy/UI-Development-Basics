# Landing Page

## Project Overview
This is a static, responsive landing page built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes a sticky header, hero section, features section with three cards, and a footer with social media links. The page is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, using CSS Grid for layouts. Optional enhancements include hover effects on buttons, navigation links, and feature cards.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tonmoy-Roy/UI-Development-Basics.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page locally.
3. No additional dependencies are required, as Tailwind CSS is included via CDN.

## Responsiveness
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu replaces navigation, hero section stacks vertically, feature cards are full-width and stacked.
- **Tablet**: Similar to mobile but with adjusted padding and font sizes.
- **Desktop**: Full layout with horizontal navigation, side-by-side hero content, and three-column feature grid.

## Enhancements
- Sticky header for better navigation.
- Hover effects on navigation links, CTA button, and feature cards.
- Smooth transitions for interactive elements.
